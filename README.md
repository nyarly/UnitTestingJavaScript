This is a RhetButler presentation

There's three ways to use it:

0. `git clone` it, and then `gem install rhet-butler` and then `rhet-butler server`
0. `git clone` it, open static/index.html in a browser.
0. You can see it [in your browser](http://nyarly.github.io/UnitTestingJavaScript)

The first one will get you the most functionality, including a presenter remote thing, but is a little trickier.
